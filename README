Commands and Options

Implemented shell commands: cd, mv, rm, ls, cp.
Additional options implemented for commands, including the recursive and help options.
Utilizes classes and objects, supports wildcard characters.
Profiling Bash Script

Creates directories with various file structures for testing.
Uses the time command to measure the execution time for each case.
Multi-threaded Implementation

Multi-threaded implementation for commands involving recursion.
Number of threads created intelligently based on available cores and workload.
Uses the multi-threaded library.
Profiling of Multi-threaded Version

Bash script to time the multi-threaded commands for each case.
Compares the performance with the previous single-threaded version.
